# Container networking on a single Docker host

In this exercise, we will bring up both of the containers for our application and connect them to each other so our Node.js API can communicate with our MongoDB database.

## Default networks

By default, your Docker Engine already has some default networks:

```bash
$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME            DRIVER
d87b8fc4c466        bridge          bridge
efaf610f57a5        host            host
f7d0de539edd        none            null
```

By default (if no `--net` option is provided), Docker Engine will attach each container to the bridge network (ID _d87b8fc4c466_ in the output above, although network IDs will vary).

## Default bridge network

Let's run 2 containers using the default bridge network without using the `--net` option, to see how they behave.

```
$ docker run --name mongo -d mongo:4.2
$ docker run --name box -d busybox top
```

Make sure the containers are listed in the bridge network. You'll need your bridge NETWORK ID from the earlier command and substitute that in place of `d87b8fc4c466` in the example below (or you could just use the name `bridge` instead of the ID):

```bash
$ docker network inspect --format='{{json .Containers}}' d87b8fc4c466 | python -m json.tool
{
    "0b8fedf4613c7275d89861037ea1b23ad4d65ab10f16df67bf976d9cb5652311": {
        "EndpointID": "0cf0cd3b2e0438c6f68c6a1e2f7587b63c48bda74911af55d1040f0d2fb117d2",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.3/16",
        "IPv6Address": "",
        "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:03",
        "Name": "mongo"
    },
    "6cb5e5f4a1bcc37925407b39f2dde41f2b370fc48a21f8289da91d17b3763a4c": {
        "EndpointID": "2a6412d3c3c25545a59ea148e317b2046965c0fe5c1eeae2c51f4f882aaa6b36",
        "IPv4Address": "172.17.0.2/16",
        "IPv6Address": "",
        "MacAddress": "02:42:ac:11:00:02",
        "Name": "box"
    }
}
```

The `Name` field tells us that both the `mongo` and `box` containers are connected to the bridge network. However, **they cannot address each other by their names** because we did not expose or publish any ports for either container to use. On the default bridge network the default behavior is to isolate every container.

```bash
# start a new busybox container and run an interactive shell:
$ docker run -ti busybox /bin/sh

# try to ping our other containers:
/ $ ping mongo
ping: bad address 'mongo'
/ $ ping box
ping: bad address 'box'

/ $ exit
```

## User defined bridge network

When we create a user defined network, the behaviour is different than the default bridge network.

Let's create a user defined bridge network with Docker network commands

```bash
# cleanup our earlier containers:
$ docker container stop box mongo && docker container rm box mongo
box
mongo

# create a new network
$ docker network create mongonet
ce9ea3b69d6ee2ecf56b40bd35b8a43f8505c8ca0473bc37bdede3711ecf60c1

$ docker network ls
NETWORK ID          NAME            DRIVER
d87b8fc4c466        bridge          bridge
efaf610f57a5        host            host
ce9ea3b69d6e        mongonet        bridge
f7d0de539edd        none            null
```

Let's now run 2 containers in the newly defined network

```
$ docker run --name mongo --net mongonet -d mongo:3.2

$ docker run --net mongonet -ti busybox /bin/sh
/ # ping -c 3 mongo
PING mongo (172.18.0.2): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.18.0.2: seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.058 ms

--- mongo ping statistics ---

/ # exit
$ docker container stop box mongo && docker container rm mongo
box
mongo
````

Containers can be addressed by their name through the DNS name server embedded in Docker 1.10+

## Running our full application

Run db and application containers in the new bridge network

```bash
$ docker run --name mongo --net mongonet -d mongo:4.2
0dd9fd6a3108caa7cac6709ce89e60c5e474b4a051becac7562c4f30efeba293

$ docker run --name app --net mongonet -p 8000:1337 -d -e "MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo/messageApp" message-app:latest
2d52bb5772f771b8ddb9177cbd5c9a53e6e1915743a129a09add10805b48a967
```

Note: The `-e` switch sets an environment variable MONGO_URL inside the container which directly uses **mongo** containerâ€™s name

Test HTTP Rest API

```bash
# Create a  new message
$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:8000/message?text=hello
{
  "text": "hello",
  "createdAt": "1569451938332",
  "updatedAt": "1569451938332",
  "id": "57558221a4461312009ce88c"
}

# Retrieve the list of message and make sure the previous message is present
$ curl -XGET http://localhost:8000/message
[
  {
    "text": "hello",
    "createdAt": "1569451938332",
    "updatedAt": "1569451938332",
    "id": "57558221a4461312009ce88c"
  }
]

# cleanup
$ docker container stop mongo app && docker container rm mongo app
mongo
app
mongo
app
```

The application container (named **app**) is connected to mongo container using container name (named **mongo**).

**Congratulations! You've successfully containerized your application!**

However, there is a better way to specify and run multiple containers together rather than manually creating a network, then launching each container separately with all the switches to wire it up.

## Specifying the application services with Docker Compose

The following file defines the whole application. Better yet, it's using images from Docker Hub so you can take this Compose file to any system with Docker Engine and run it the same way, with the same images.

Copy this code into a file on your system named `docker-compose.yaml` - don't forget to substitute your own Docker Hub image for the `app:` service.

```yaml
version: '3.6'
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:4.2
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    expose:
      - "27017"
  app:
    # NOTE: you should substitute your own Docker Hub info below
    image: jimmyarms/labs-nodejs:001
    ports:
      - "1337"
    links:
      - mongo
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo/messageApp
volumes:
  mongo-data:
```

The important part of this file:

* Definition of 2 services
  * database service: **mongo**
  * application service: **app**
* Link between **app** and **mongo** services done through the MONGO_URL environment variable (using **mongo** service name)
* Port mapping
  * mongo service EXPOSEs port 27017 (default MongoDB port) only to the other services listed in this Compose file (not to the Docker host).
  * app service uses a `port` specification, which means the port will be published and mapped to a random port on the host, as no host port as been defined. If you want to define the port you would use `<external port>:<internal port>` instead of the single port number shown here.
* Definition of a user defined volume for mongodb data folder

## Lifecycle and scalability

The following commands are some of the main ones to interact with the application

* Start your application again, this time using Compose:
  * `docker-compose up -d` (-d option enables the application to run in background)
* Check the status of each services composing the application `docker-compose ps`
  * If you want to send & check for a test msg as we did above, you can see which port is being used by the `app` container in the output. It will look something like `0.0.0.0:32770->1337/tcp`. The port is random but in this instance Docker Engine mapped port 32770 so we would use that in the `curl` commands shown above.

---
## Load Balancing

* Scale up the application service instances: `docker-compose scale app=3`
* Several containers of the app service (our Node.js API) are running and are accessible through random port number of the Docker host. How are the new instantiated containers addressed?

![3 api containers](images/compose_3apps.png)

* If you run `docker-compose ps` again you'll see all the containers and the ports they're using.

```bash
       Name                     Command               State                Ports             
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
messageapp_app_1     docker-entrypoint.sh npm start   Up      0.0.0.0:32774->1337/tcp, 80/tcp
messageapp_app_2     docker-entrypoint.sh npm start   Up      0.0.0.0:32776->1337/tcp, 80/tcp
messageapp_app_3     docker-entrypoint.sh npm start   Up      0.0.0.0:32775->1337/tcp, 80/tcp
messageapp_mongo_1   docker-entrypoint.sh mongod      Up      27017/tcp
```

To make the application more usable and provide the ability scale up and down without keeping track of all the separate port mappings, we need to add a load balancer that will be updated each time a container is created or removed and that will forward each request to a running instance of the app service.

Shut down the app to prepare for improvements: `docker-compose down`

## Usage of dockercloud/haproxy image

[dockercloud/haproxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/dockercloud/haproxy) is a good candidate to be used in front of our **app** service. It will update it's configuration each time a container is started / stopped.

![load balancer](images/compose_lb.png)

> **NOTE:** dockercloud/haproxy is a custom version of the open source haproxy application. It is not recommended for general use but is used here for simplicity. If you need load balancing for your applications you should investigate other solutions like upstream haproxy, traefix, or nginx.

## Adding dockercloud/haproxy load balancer to our Compose file

You can copy the below and overwrite your existing `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
version: '3.6'
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:4.2
    volumes:
      - mongo-data:/data/db
    expose:
      - "27017"
    networks:
      - backend
  lbapp:
    image: dockercloud/haproxy
    depends_on:
      - app
    environment:
      - BALANCE=leastconn
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ports:
      - 80:80
    links:
      - app
    networks:
      - frontend
  app:
    # NOTE: you should substitute your own Docker Hub image info below
    image: jimmyarms/labs-nodejs:001
    ports:
      - 1337
    environment:
     - SERVICE_PORTS=1337
    depends_on:
      - mongo
    environment:
      - MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo/messageApp
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
volumes:
  mongo-data:
networks:
  frontend:
  backend:
```

The load balancer service has been added to the picture.
Each request coming to port 80 of the host (mapped with port 80 of **lbapp** service) is LINKed to the **api** through the load balancer.

## Test our application

Run the new version of our compose file and specify the number of instances of the **app** service:

* `docker-compose up -d`
* `docker-compose scale app=3`

Let's just test the creation and retrieval of a message

```bash
$ curl -XPOST http://localhost/message?text=hello
{
  "text": "hola",
  "createdAt": "1569471622195",
  "updatedAt": "1569471622195",
  "id": "57581deacde05a1200877fa2"
}

$ curl -XPOST http://localhost/message?text=hola
{
  "text": "hello",
  "createdAt": "1569471622195",
  "updatedAt": "1569471622195",
  "id": "57581deacde05a1200877fa2"
}

$ curl -XPOST http://localhost/message?text=hallo
{
  "text": "bonjour",
  "createdAt": "1569471622195",
  "updatedAt": "1569471622195",
  "id": "57581deacde05a1200877fa2"
}

$ curl -XPOST http://localhost/message?text=bonjour
{
  "text": "hallo",
  "createdAt": "1569471622195",
  "updatedAt": "1569471622195",
  "id": "57581deacde05a1200877fa2"
}

$ curl -XGET http://localhost/message
[
  {
    "text": "hello",
    "createdAt": 1569471622195,
    "updatedAt": 1569471622195,
    "id": "5d8c3c86eae3da001839edab"
  },
  {
    "text": "hola",
    "createdAt": 1569472066058,
    "updatedAt": 1569472066058,
    "id": "5d8c3e42eae3da001839edac"
  },
  {
    "text": "hallo",
    "createdAt": 1569472211485,
    "updatedAt": 1569472211485,
    "id": "5d8c3ed3eae3da001839edad"
  },
  {
    "text": "bonjour",
    "createdAt": 1569472218921,
    "updatedAt": 1569472218921,
    "id": "5d8c3eda3caf44001901ab7c"
  }
]
```

Congratulations! You've now containerized your application, deployed it locally behind a load balancer so you can scale up and down.
